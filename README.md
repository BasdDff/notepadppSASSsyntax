SASS Syntax Highlighting XML for Notepad++ (Obsidian theme) 
===============================================

There are a lot of capable editors that support SCSS natively around, but if you'd like to stick to Notepad++, here's a custom syntax highlighting config XML file for you.

Please note that colors are based on the "Obsidian" theme bundled with Notepad++. 

# Usage

## To enable SCSS syntax highlighting:

*   In Notepad++, open the `Language` and menu and select `User Defined Dialog...`
*   Click on the import button and select the XML file located in our ZIP file
*   After restarting Notepad++ your files with the *.scss* extension should now be highlighted

## To enable autocomplete:

*   go to your Notepad++ folder then to `/plugins/APIs/`
*   duplicate the `css.xml` and rename this file to `Obsidian_SCSS.xml`
